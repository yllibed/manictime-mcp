# Legal and Branding Guidelines

This document provides project-level wording guidance for compatibility claims.

This is not legal advice. If uncertainty exists, consult qualified legal counsel before release.

## Approved Compatibility Wording

Use one of the following baseline statements:

- "Independent integration for ManicTime local desktop data."
- "Not affiliated with or endorsed by ManicTime or Finkit."

## Disallowed or Restricted Wording

Do not publish wording that implies:

- official certification
- formal partnership
- endorsement by ManicTime/Finkit

Unless written authorization exists.

## Trademark and Brand Use

- Use the product name only as needed to describe compatibility.
- Do not use logos, brand marks, or visual identity assets without explicit permission.
- Keep brand references factual and minimal.

## Required Disclaimer Snippet (Template)

"This project is an independent, community-maintained integration. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ManicTime or Finkit."

## NuGet/README/Release Note Placement

Place a disclaimer in:

- repository `README.md`
- package description/release notes
- website/docs landing page (if applicable)

## Data and Privacy Positioning

- Describe default behavior as local and read-only.
- Avoid claims about legal compliance guarantees for user organizations.
- If users process employee/customer data, they remain responsible for their own compliance obligations.

## Promotion Guidance

Prefer measurable technical claims:

- local read-only operation
- stdio transport
- deterministic test coverage and CI quality gates

Avoid unverified comparative or superlative claims.
