# ADR Index

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant, durable decisions.

## Rules

- Use one ADR per decision.
- ADRs are immutable after acceptance; supersede with a new ADR.
- Any contract-breaking decision must have an ADR.

## Naming

- `NNNN-short-title.md` (for example `0001-stdio-only-transport.md`).

## Status Values

- Proposed
- Accepted
- Superseded
- Rejected

## Initial ADR Candidates

- stdio-only transport for v1
- net10 + self-contained packaging profile
- centralized build/package/versioning policy
- screenshot strategy and availability diagnostics
- no persistent self-attached project MCP in workspace
